## <u>Introduction</u>
This website is created for my friend Egle Ratkeviciute, who is expanding and advertising services of personal training for people within Coventry City, United Kingdom. To offer a unique service for Egle's clientell and utilize my requirement of Project 2 for my Level 5 diploma through Code Instistute. The websites requirements will need to display a friendly/approachable service with listings of capabilities and benefits offered to the user.

As a service tool, the website will include a feature to track and plan their calories intake. Offering a unqiue benefit over local competition.

## <u>Approach</u>

## <u>Designing of the Website</u>
   ### Structure of the site
   ### Color Scheme
   ### Font Selection
   ### Mobile Design
   For mobile phones, the width of screens are limited with widths and selection area. To counter this, the wireframe created follows a simple flow with exception of two fields where the image is related to the information adjacent and less volume.<br>

   ### Tablet Design
   Similar to the above Mobile Design, Tablets offer a wider screen view but with it's cursor selection requiring space as these are mostly navigated by fingertips. The additional space offers more room to expand on font sizes, division blocks and the images.<br>

   ### Laptop Plus Design
   Laptops or desktop offer the clearest visual displays and accurate selection with mouse pointers. This factor has been counted in when drawing the wireframe for the final display stage, allowing images to be adjacent to the text but spread across the page, information boxes to be wider and displayed inline for easier comparison.<br>
