## <u>Introduction</u>
This website is created for my friend Egle Ratkeviciute, who is expanding and advertising services of personal training for people within Coventry City, United Kingdom. To offer a unique service for Egle's clientell and utilize my requirement of Project 2 for my Level 5 diploma through Code Instistute. The websites requirements will need to display a friendly/approachable service with listings of capabilities and benefits offered to the user.

As a service tool, the website will include a feature to track and plan their calories intake. Offering a unqiue benefit over local competition.

## <u>Research</u>
1. characteristics of personal trainers
    * Routine
        1. For personal trainers to optimize their clients muscle growth, a schedule is created with the client for type of excersizes, daily routine and removal of bad-habits.
            1. This feature can be met with an "objectives" chart or progression feedback at a later stage of the website application. 
    * Consumption
        1. A huge impactor to personal training and gaining muscle is the balance of consumption. A Healthy maintenance of weight and muscles requires Women to consume approximately 2,000 calories per day and Men to consume 2,500 calories per day.<br>
        Egle's approach is to adjust the calorie requirement to customers on an independent basis. i.e a new starter who needs to add mass to convert to muscle will be given a target of 3,000 calories, or an existing client needing to gain muscle but already started on the base 3,500 will be increased to 4,000.
        2. Browsing over websites, several guides have included the reason for calories, how to count calories or even types of food, i.e protein.
        website [www.omnicalculator.com/health/meal-calorie#how-many-calories-per-meal-should-i-eat](https://www.omnicalculator.com/health/meal-calorie#how-many-calories-per-meal-should-i-eat)
            note as I was previously researching this website was displayed as an information/blog post. since this has been created as a calculator too. My coding has not been influenced from this website.
    * Excersize
2. Identification of uses
3. Information/Methods required

## <u>Approach</u>

## <u>Designing of the Website</u>
   ### Structure of the site
   ### Color Scheme
   ### Font Selection
   ### Mobile Design
   For mobile phones, the width of screens are limited with widths and selection area. To counter this, the wireframe created follows a simple flow with exception of two fields where the image is related to the information adjacent and less volume.<br>
   <img src = "assets/images/readme_files/mobile_view.png" alt = "Design for mobile screens" height="450px">

   ### Tablet Design
   Similar to the above Mobile Design, Tablets offer a wider screen view but with it's cursor selection requiring space as these are mostly navigated by fingertips. The additional space offers more room to expand on font sizes, division blocks and the images.<br>
   <img src = "assets/images/readme_files/tablet_view.png" alt="Design for tablet screens" height = "450px">

   ### Laptop Plus Design
   Laptops or desktop offer the clearest visual displays and accurate selection with mouse pointers. This factor has been counted in when drawing the wireframe for the final display stage, allowing images to be adjacent to the text but spread across the page, information boxes to be wider and displayed inline for easier comparison.<br>

## <u>Expected Uses of Website</u>

## <u>Focus of the Project</u>
*********************
## <u>Progression of Website</u>
### Start
* resources available before project started
* Text provided for website
* Logo

#### Mid-project
#### Final stage
#### Future developments
 1. Objective and target board to be included as part of an app/login feature. (research 1, Routine)

## <u>Test & Bugs</u>
 1. Inner HTML removing instantly after applying
 2. If table allowed 3 and 4 to be displayed with different answers, but 5 was not showing
 3. Imported tables not showing headers
### Fixed
### Current Bugs
