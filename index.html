                <div id="greeting-right">
                    <p>My name is Egle and for more than 10 years, I’ve followed my passion for improving health, fitness and overall emotional wellbeing. 
                        I love to challenge myself and as well as working on my own fitness goals, I also took up boxing recently and one of my favourite ways to relax 
                        is on a surfboard in the ocean.
 
                        As a teenager and young adult, I was overweight and I struggled with my own body image and self-confidence. 
                        I’ve been through the whole journey and I know how hard it is to motivate yourself when often you don’t know where to begin. 
                        It can be hard to make a start when you can’t visualise yourself becoming who you really want to be, and that’s where I come in.
                         
                        The first step to making a change is definitely the hardest. As well as working with people who are on their way to becoming the best version of themselves,
                         I’ve also devised fitness and nutrition programmes for people who live with mental health issues, people who were severely overweight,
                          and people with specific health conditions or physical difficulties. These programmes were each tailored to those individual’s circumstances and I
                           supported them with sensitivity and understanding. So no matter where you are in your journey to become happier, healthier and stronger, I will support
                            and motivate you to achieve your goals.
                         
                        Come and find me in the gym or take one of my business cards to chat with me by phone, email or on Instagram.
