                    <p>My name is Egle and for more than 10 years, I’ve followed my passion for improving health, fitness and overall emotional wellbeing. 
                        I love to challenge myself and as well as working on my own fitness goals, I also took up boxing recently and one of my favourite ways to relax 
                        is on a surfboard in the ocean.<br>
                        
                        The first step to making a change is definitely the hardest. As well as working with people who are on their way to becoming the best version of themselves,
                         I’ve also devised fitness and nutrition programmes for people who live with mental health issues, people who were severely overweight,
                          and people with specific health conditions or physical difficulties. <br>These programmes were each tailored to those individual’s circumstances and I
                           supported them with sensitivity and understanding. So no matter where you are in your journey to become happier, healthier and stronger, I will support
                            and motivate you to achieve your goals.

                <h3>Eric's experience:</h3>
                    <p>When I met Egle, I was 8 stone (around 43kg) overweight. I was completely lost and felt like there was nothing I would ever be able to do to change myself. 
                    But Egle helped me to make that first leap into losing weight and pushed me to keep going. I’ve lost 6 stone with her help. 
                    It’s not an exaggeration to say she changed my life. Maybe even saved my life.

                <h3>Eddie's experience:</h3>
                    <p>No one else could get me up and moving at 5am! Egle really believes in you and makes you believe in yourself, 
                    and then those early starts don’t feel so bad.

                    <p>Thank you so much for everything you’ve done for me over the last 6 months. Because of you, I’m going to walk down the aisle feeling beautiful and confident. 
                    I might even put a bikini on when I go on honeymoon!

                    <p>Egle makes it fun and enjoyable to train. She does work me hard but she encourages me so much at the same time. I love our sessions!

                <h3>Rachel's experience:</h3>
                    <p>Egle is great. When I first came to the gym, I was skinny and intimidated by the equipment. With Egle’s knowledge of nutrition and training, I’ve gained ……..kg and my strength has really improved.
